Hello! I'm Enrique, a seasoned System Administrator turned cloud Platform Engineer with a passion for driving innovation and efficiency in cloud-based environments. With extensive expertise in deploying and managing highly scalable infrastructures, I leverage a deep knowledge of technologies such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, Clouds, CI/CD and monitoring tools such Datadog or prometheus stack. 

And yes, I can automate everything, except keeping my cats awy my houseplants... but I'm working on it!
